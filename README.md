# PhD_Python_Scripts
Here are some scripts I wrote during my PhD. I worked with metal nanoparticle, and I wrote some code that helped me deal with atoms coordinates and working on them
[Wiki](https://github.com/AlbertKurtz/PhD_Python_Scripts/wiki) 

I will appreciate any comment or critic, both on the theory and on my coding. Write at <albert.flor.mail@gmail.com>
